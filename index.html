        <p>I start to build my blog at 2020.1.12 with github page and jekyll. I am good at front-end so I choose to complete it with this. Github is
          a big platform and safe for use. We developer just need to devote ourselves to blog writting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's what I first thought about blogging, and what I want to say to myself:
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, before I wrote my blog, I read many people's blogs. Most of the ordinary people's blogs are really not many. 
          My roommates and my friends also have blogs, and some have self built stations. But many people are in the third degree of enthusiasm,
           and many people are even more enthusiastic. No one's looking, that's why many people. I think blogging is not so much about letting others see it, 
           but about letting ourselves see it. If we make this point clear, then everything will be easy to explain in the future. How are you?
            Why do people look at you? Is what you say valuable? Can you charge for your blog? Do people care what you think? I don't think so, why do you write your blog to others?
             If you started writing for someone else, I advise you not to. Because no one will see it. And if you write a blog or even your own domain name to show off, 
             I don't think it's necessary. I think if you have nothing on your blog or personal website for more than a year or more, I think it's a waste of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the purpose of my blog is to let myself see my learning process, take notes, understand my growth and deepen my learning level.I'll write in a simple way, easier to understand way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Emotion part seems like diary which record my emotion and experience everyday. This part maybe only useful for myself.
          Notes record my thoughts about learning. Maybe there are something wrong in it, if you find some wrong in it please contact with me.
          Share part let me share other some resoures and recommend about product and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because I use github page and jekyll to build my blog, it's simple and friendly for front-end developer, 
          it can also limit us to use ours skill to decorate website and show blogs. It's unfortunate, you should understand if you wanted to use other
          people's wheels, you have to obey others rule. The link in my article is shown in orange, if you click it, it can turn to other website.
